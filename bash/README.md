# GNU Bash - A legitimate interface to your computer

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU  
Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.  
First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most  
Linux distributions. Bash was one of the first programs Linus Torvalds ported   
to Linux, alongside GCC.<sup>([ref][1])</sup>
